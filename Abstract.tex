This thesis describes the development of a fully automated feedback system that was built and made available to offer early learners of object-oriented programming customized and useful feedback hints. To evaluate the robustness of students' JUnit assignment solutions, this system made use of the PiTest mutation-testing tool. Students used this system to submit their assignment solutions and they received customized feedback hints that were better than those generated by PiTest tool.\par

The study's main objective was to assess the significance and usefulness of customizable feedback hints for early learners taking object-oriented programming courses, as well as the extent to which these hints would be adjusted to provide a successful and productive learning environment.\par

The findings of this study showed that test-based, fully automated evaluation with the help of the PiTest mutation testing tool could be used to successfully provide a large number of programming students with timely feedback and help them improve their programming skills and knowledge.  The technology allows professors or tutors to adjust the feedback system's Mutation Threshold score to determine whether a student's test suite is good or bad at first glance.

% Feedback messages for programming assignments are important in order for students to improve their understanding and skills in programming. However, it can be difficult for teachers or even tutors to provide timely feedback for all assignments due to the large number of students participating in programming courses nowadays.  Test-based fully automated assessment is a popular method for achieving this goal, whereby a tutor or professor provides the students with programming assignments for the students to submit their solutions and the system automatically evaluates the correctness of the student assignments, which then provides feedback to the students.
% This master thesis presents the development of a fully automated feedback system that gives meaningful customizable feedback hints to early learners of Object-Oriented Programming students with basic knowledge of JUnit testing. PiTest mutation testing tool was utilized to evaluate the quality of the studentsâ€™ submitted JUnit assignment solutions.  Students will be able to submit their solutions and receive lucid feedback hints that are better compared to those generated by PiTest. Nevertheless, the feedback message will be made easy for students to understand and will be provided to students directly to their provided E-Mail addresses. As result, I explore the usefulness of the customizable feedback hints for the early learners.
